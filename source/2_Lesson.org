- A young person is breaking the law if they:
  - Take an explicit photo or video of themselves or a friend
  - Share an explicit image or video of a child, even if shared between children of the same age
  - Possess, download or store an explicit image or video of a child, even if the child gave their permission for it to be created.
** Learn It: The Police
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- From January 2016 in England and Wales, if a young person is found creating or sharing images, the police can choose to record that a crime has been committed but that taking formal action isn't in the public interest. 
- Crimes recorded this way are unlikely to appear on future records or checks, unless you have been involved in other similar activities which may indicate that you're at risk.
- If you’re both under 18 and in a healthy relationship it’s unlikely that the police would want to take things further.
** Learn It: Discussion

- Discuss the following questions with the person next to you, then record your thoughts on a Notepad or Word document:
  - What might motivate someone to send a nude selfie to someone else?
  - What advice would you give a friend if they suggested they were considering sending a nude selfie to a boyfriend or girlfriend? Why would you say that? 
  - What consequences might there be to sending a nude selfie?
  - What advice would you give to a friend who send a nude selfie to a boyfriend/girlfriend and is concerned it has been circulated around others in school?

- The NSPCC have researched this area, and they estimate that between 15%-40% of young people have been involved in sexting. 
- Their research shows that issues most commonly come from sexting between peers
- They found that young people are commonly coerced into sending nude selfies
- Girls most adversely affected, and access to technology amplifies the problem
- Ever younger children are being affected.


- The NSPCC advise the "Grandma rule" when sending images of yourself:
- /Only send pictures to people that you'd be happy to show your grandma./
- The NSPCC have produced a free app called 'Zipit' which comes with a number of humourous comeback lines that can be used in response to requests for nude selfies. 
- You can pick it up for iPhone [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zipit/id721031543?ls%3D1&mt%3D8][here]], or [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Duk.org.childline.zipit][here]] for Android.
