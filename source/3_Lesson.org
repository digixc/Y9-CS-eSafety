  - Passing the blame: "This is all /their/ fault. Everything was fine until /they/ came along"
  - Youth speak: "Tell us how you feel about student loans in 3 emojis"
  - Bold statements: "If you do/buy this, your life will be better"
  - Association: "If this celebrity does it, it must be good. You should do it too"
  - Lesser of two evils: Convincing you to make a bad decision by comparing it to something worse. 
  - Omission: "I’ll give you the full story, except I will just take out the most important part"
