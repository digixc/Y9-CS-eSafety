<ul class="org-ul">
<li>From January 2016 in England and Wales, if a young person is found creating or sharing images, the police can choose to record that a crime has been committed but that taking formal action isn't in the public interest. 
</li>
<li>Crimes recorded this way are unlikely to appear on future records or checks, unless you have been involved in other similar activities which may indicate that you're at risk.
</li>
<li>If you’re both under 18 and in a healthy relationship it’s unlikely that the police would want to take things further.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The NSPCC have researched this area, and they estimate that between 15%-40% of young people have been involved in sexting. 
</li>
<li>Their research shows that issues most commonly come from sexting between peers
</li>
<li>They found that young people are commonly coerced into sending nude selfies
</li>
<li>Girls most adversely affected, and access to technology amplifies the problem
</li>
<li>Ever younger children are being affected.
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The NSPCC advise the "Grandma rule" when sending images of yourself:
</li>
<li><i>Only send pictures to people that you'd be happy to show your grandma.</i>
</li>
<li>The NSPCC have produced a free app called 'Zipit' which comes with a number of humourous comeback lines that can be used in response to requests for nude selfies. 
</li>
<li>You can pick it up for iPhone <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zipit/id721031543?ls=1&mt=8">here</a>, or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.childline.zipit">here</a> for Android.
